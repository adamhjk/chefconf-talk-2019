Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of
thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if
it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient and
well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.

          Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare
          of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies the loss
          of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others. It does
          not allow that the sacrifices on a few are outweighed by the larger sum of
          advantages enjoyed by the many.
